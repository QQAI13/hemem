# HeMem Artifact

This document describes the artifact for our [SOSP 2021 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3477132.3483550 "SOSP 2021 paper") on HeMem. We describe how to build and run HeMem and reproduce the results from our paper.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code of HeMem, the microbenchmarks (`hemem/microbenchmarks/`) and application benchmarks (`hemem/apps/`) evaluated with HeMem.

### Building and Running HeMem

You may set up HeMem to run on your own machine provided you have Intel Optane NVM. HeMem requires a special linux kernel in order to run. That kernel is located [here](https://github.com/aj-austin/linux/tree/uffd-wp-merged "here") in the `uffd-wp-merged` branch. Edit the `INCLUDES` line in the Makefiles in the main source directory and the microbenchmarks subdirectory to point to the linux headers from this repository that you downloaded.

HeMem has a dependency on [Hoard](https://github.com/emeryberger/Hoard "Hoard"). Download, build, and install Hoard before attempting to build HeMem.

Some additional setup is required for setting up the DRAM and NVM `/dev/dax` files to run HeMem.

To set up the `/dev/dax` file representing DRAM, follow the instructions [here](https://pmem.io/2016/02/22/pm-emulation.html "here") in order to reserve a block of DRAM at machine startup to represent the DRAM `/dev/dax` file. HeMem reserves its 140GB of DRAM in this way (enough for its 128GB of reserved DRAM plus some metadata needed for `ndctl`). If your machine has multiple NUMA nodes, ensure that the block of DRAM you reserve is located on the same NUMA node that has NVM. Do not follow the last set of instructions from pmem.io on setting up a file system on the reserved DRAM. Instead, set up a `/dev/dax` file to represent it:

1. First, determine the name of the namespace representing the reserved DRAM:

`ndctl list --human`

2. You should see your reserved DRAM. If multiple namespaces are listed, some represent NVM namespaces (described below). You should be able to differentiate the DRAM namespace based on size. Your DRAM namespace is likely in `fsdax` mode. Change the namespace over to `devdax` mode using the following command (in this example, the DRAM namespace is called `namespace0.0`):

`sudo ndctl create-namespace -f -e namespace0.0 --mode=devdax --align 2M`

3. Make note of the `chardev` name of the DRAM `/dev/dax` file. This will be used to tell HeMem which `/dev/dax` file represents DRAM. If this is different from `dax0.0`, then you will need to edit the `hemem.h` file `DRAMPATH` macro to point it towards your actual DRAM `/dev/dax` file.

To set up the `/dev/dax` file representing NVM, ensure that your machine has NVM in App Direct mode. If you do not already have namespaces representing NVM, then you will need to create them. Follow these steps:

1. List the regions available on your machine:

`ndctl list --regions --human`

2. Note which regions represent NVM. You can differentiate them from the reserved DRAM region based on size or via the `persistence_domain` field, which, for NVM, will read `memory_controller`. Pick the region that is on the same NUMA node as your reserved DRAM. In this example, this is "region1". Create a namespace over this region:

`ndctl create-namespace --region=1 --mode=devdax`

3. Make note of the `chardev` name of the NVM `/dev/dax` file. This will be used to tell HeMem which `/dev/dax` file represents NVM. If this is different from `dax1.0`, then you will need to edit the `hemem.h` file `NVMPATH` macro to point it towards your actual NVM `/dev/dax` file.

Once the proper kernel version is running and the `/dev/dax` files have been set up, HeMem can be built with the supplied Makefile by typing `make` from the `src/` directory.

You will likely need to add the paths to the build HeMem library and the Hoard library to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable:

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path/to/hemem/lib:/path/to/Hoard/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

You may also need to increase the number of allowed mmap ranges:

`echo 1000000 > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count`

HeMem requires the user be root in order to run. Applications can either be linked with Hemem or run unmodified via the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.

### Microbenchmarks

A Makefile is provided to build the GUPS microbenchmarks.

To reproduce the Uniform GUPS results, run the `run-random.sh` script. Results will be printed to the `random.txt` file. The throughput results shown in the paper are the "GUPS" lines.

To reproduce the Hotset GUPS results, run the `run.sh` script. Results will be printed to the `results.txt` file. The throughput results shown in the paper are the "GUPS" lines.

To reproduce the Instantaneous GUPS results, run the `run-instantaneous.sh` script. Results will be printed to the `tot_gups.txt` file.

### Application Benchmarks

Applications tested with HeMem are located in the `apps/` directory.

#### Silo 

The Silo application can be found in the `apps/silo_hemem/silo` directory.. Run the provided `run_batch.sh` script. Results will be in the `batch/results.txt` file. The reported throughput numbers are numbers in the first column of the file.

#### FlexKVS

The FlexKVS application can be found in the `apps/flexkvs` directory. These results require a separate machine for the clients.

#### GapBS

The GapBS application can be found in the `apps/gapbs` directory. To run the BC algorithm reported in the paper, you may run the following command:

`LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/hemem/lib ./bc -g <scale>`

which will run the bc algorithm with HeMem on a graph with 2^scale vertices.
